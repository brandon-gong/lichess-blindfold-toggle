# Lichess Blindfold Toggle
This extension adds a stupid-simple button to the URL bar of Lichess pages that
allows you to toggle blindfold mode on and off (without having to navigate off
of the page and into your settings).

Currently, this extension is only for FireFox; however, if there's interest,
I can look into making this work for Chrome. Feedback is welcome!
